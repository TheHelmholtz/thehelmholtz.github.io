I am no longer actively doing research, but I still enjoy thinking about how to model the world with unsupervised
methods.

A few things that I think haven't entered mainstream unsupervised methods:

- Model: model that accomodates an unlimited set of object entities (or event episodes)
- Inference: iterative and active inference
- Learning: symmetric learning (e.g. [this](/blog/symmetric_vae))
