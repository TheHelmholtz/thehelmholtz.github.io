I am HOU Yunqing:
{% include icon-github.html username="hyqneuron" %} {% include icon-linkedin.html pagename="hou-yunqing" %}. 

I write about neurally-inspired methods of machine learning in this blog. I've been a connectionist for half of my life.
I'm still passionate about how the brain works, and its underlying statistical principles. 

I am inexperienced and still learning. I very much appreciate people who point out my mistakes.

## Research direction

* Variance reduction for large categorical variables
* MCMC with Langevin dynamics as a mechanism of top-down attention and memory recall
