I am HOU Yunqing:
{% include icon-github.html username="hyqneuron" %} {% include icon-linkedin.html pagename="hou-yunqing" %}. 

I write about neurally-inspired methods of machine learning in this blog. I've been a believer of the connectionist
approach for about half of my life. And I am still passionate about the statistical principles underlying attention and
memory.

> mistakes.
