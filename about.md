We are proponents of the Bayesian Brain. Using the framework of free energy minimization and approximate + exact
inference, we develop neurally-inspired methods of perception, attention, memory, action and planning.


## Active Projects

These are the projects we are currently working on:

- Variational Autoencoder with multimodal likelihood and posterior
- Variational Autoencoder with symmetric cost (Extended Helmholtz Machine)
- MCMC with Langevin dynamics as a mechanism of top-down attention and memory recall
- Variance reduction for large categorical variables
